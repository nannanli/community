- **Branch management**
   - Docs-staging protected so you cannot push directly. 
   - To publish docs, need to create an intermediate branch for conflict resolution.
   - what's the flow now?   
     1. create your feature branch off docs-staging -->2. Create pull request and merge into docs-staging; 3. Before new release publish, merge docs-staging to master. If there are conflicts, need to create an intermediate branch and resolve conflicts. 

- **PR template** 
   - Sample: https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md
   - Need support from more squad for pilot run. 
   - Need to make it clear what's required, optional. 
   - Share the template somewhere (i.e. in Box), send it to doc squad and gather feedback from different squads.
